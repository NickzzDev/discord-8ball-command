# discord-8ball-command
This command is a magic 8ball, which answers your question in the most accurate way haha. 

This command will only be provided in v13, but feel free to change it to v12 if you are still running the old discord.js.

I have left my credits in the description, and i would like to ask you to keep it, as i made this command and providing it to you myself, so i would appreciate it if you can keep it. Thanks, and enjoy!
